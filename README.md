c=int(input("Enter any sequence"))
# The first section takes the values inputted by the user and puts them into the equation.
# However, they must be a valid integer. 

Area=0.25*((a+ b+c)*(-a+b+c)*(a-b+c)*(a+b-c))**.5
# The second section here is the equation that python will use to calculate the area. 

print (Area)
# Third section prints the calculated area in the shell, and is labled "Area".
